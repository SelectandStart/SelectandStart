Select and Start is a gaming community that is ran by Giygas and Chaoticly. We both run the community, to make sure the servers remain a fun place for everyone to be. During all of this work, Giygas also maintains, updates, codes, and manages the website, staff concerns, people management, and handles most of the Public Relations matters. Chaoticly works behind the scenes, where all the magic happens with hardware, firmware, and software.
